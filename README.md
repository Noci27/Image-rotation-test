# Image Rotation Test
This is a little playground where I tested the CSS ```rotate3d()``` funtion. The original intend was to replicate the spinning effect from *Tetris DS* as can be seen [here](https://youtu.be/Q0aNx-XBGTI&3m10s). However that did not quite turn out the way I wanted to due to the way the ```rotate3d()``` function works, so the image just follows the cursor around.

There is a little secret to be found though :)
